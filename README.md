# Northern Roads - Grass Remover

This is a Synthesis patcher that will go through every cell in your load order, check if it's modified by Northern Roads, and remove grass from certain [Landscape Textures](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim_Mod:Mod_File_Format/LTEX) if it is. This prevents grass from growing onto the roads, which looks weird.
